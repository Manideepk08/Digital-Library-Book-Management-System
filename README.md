# Digital-Library-Book-Management-System
Overview
The Library Book Management System is a console-based application written in Java that allows librarians to add, view, update, search, and delete books from a catalog. Each book has details like Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, and Availability Status. The system ensures the Book ID is unique, Title and Author are non-empty, and Availability Status is either Available or Checked Out.

Key Features:

-Add a new book to the catalog.

-View all books in the catalog.

-Search for a book by its ID or Title.

-Update book details (e.g., change availability status, update title, or author).

-Delete a book record from the catalog.

-Exit the application gracefully.

Challenges Faced During Development:

-Input Validation and Error Handling:

One of the early challenges I encountered was ensuring that user input was validated properly. For example, ensuring that the Book ID was unique and that the availabilityStatus could only be "Available" or "Checked Out".I initially used multiple loops and conditions to handle this validation, but this caused some repetitive code. Later, I refactored the code to create reusable methods for input validation, which streamlined the process.

-Managing Data in Memory:

Initially, I used a simple HashMap to store the books. This works fine for a small-scale application, but for a more realistic system, this approach would not scale well. If the system needed to persist data (e.g., saving to a file or database), this structure would need to be improved. As a result, I decided to keep the system as a simple in-memory solution, but I recognized that persistence could be a natural extension in future iterations of this project.

-User Interface Design:

The application is purely console-based, which means the user experience is limited to text input and output. While this is sufficient for the given task, it could be improved by creating a GUI or a web-based interface for a better user experience.I spent time planning the flow of interactions and ensuring that the interface was intuitive, but further refinement could make it even more user-friendly (e.g., better prompts, clearer output).

-Modularity and Code Organization:

Initially, all the code was in a single file, which was difficult to manage as the project grew. I spent time refactoring the code to separate it into different packages (e.g., model, service, ui) to improve organization and maintainability. This made the code more modular and easier to extend.
However, with more time, I would further modularize and refactor the code to ensure each class has a single responsibility.

Improvements If Given More Time:

-Persistent Data Storage:

Implementing persistent storage would allow the library to retain the data even after the application is closed. I would integrate file-based storage (like JSON or CSV) or even a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to persist books and their details.

-Improved User Interface (UI):

Moving from a command-line interface to a GUI or web-based interface would significantly improve the user experience. A GUI using JavaFX or a web interface with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would make it more accessible to non-technical users.

-Error Handling and Logging:

While basic error handling has been implemented, I would enhance the system by adding more robust exception handling for edge cases (e.g., handling invalid input more gracefully). Additionally, implementing logging (e.g., using java.util.logging or log4j) would help track user actions and potential errors for debugging and auditing.

-Unit Testing:

While I did not include unit tests in the initial implementation, adding unit tests with JUnit or a similar testing framework would ensure that all methods in the Library class (and other classes) are functioning correctly. This would be important as the system evolves and more features are added.

-Advanced Features:

More advanced features could be added, such as:

Search by multiple fields (e.g., search by genre and availability status).

Sorting books based on different attributes (e.g., by title, author, or availability).

A checkout system where users can "borrow" books and see if they're currently checked out.


Conclusion:

This Library Book Management System is a simple, console-based Java application that provides essential features for managing books in a library catalog. While there are some areas for improvement, especially in terms of scalability, user experience, and persistence, the current system meets the basic requirements of the project. If given more time, I would focus on adding persistence, improving the UI, and writing extensive unit tests to ensure reliability and robustness.Conclusion
